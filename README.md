## Technologies Used

### Rick and Morty API with GraphQL
The Rick and Morty API is a RESTful and GraphQL API based on the television show "Rick and Morty". It allows us to fetch data about characters, episodes, and locations. By using GraphQL, we can request specific data and handle complex queries efficiently.

### React
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows us to create reusable UI components, manage state, and build single-page applications (SPAs) with ease.

### Vite
Vite is a fast build tool and development server for modern web projects. It provides a highly optimized development environment with fast hot module replacement (HMR).

### TypeScript
TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript. It adds static typing to the language, making the code more robust and easier to maintain.

### Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. It provides low-level utility classes that can be composed to build any design directly in your markup.

### ShadCN
ShadCN is a component library that provides pre-designed and customizable UI components. It helps speed up the development process by offering ready-to-use components that adhere to modern design principles.
